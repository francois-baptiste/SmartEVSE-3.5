# How to configure

## Getting started

1. **Start in Normal mode.** Walk through the settings shown on the LCD. At first, leave MAINS MET unconfigured. Set CONFIG, PWR SHARE, MAX, and the hardware settings (SWITCH, RCMON, RFID, WIFI).
2. **Test Normal mode.** Verify your EV charges at MAX current. If you don't need Smart charging and have no mains meter, you are done.
3. **Configure your mains meter.** Set MODE to Smart, then configure MAINS MET. New settings will appear in the menu (MAINS, MIN, and more). Browse through them again. See the [Power Input Methods guide](power-input-methods.md) for help choosing and configuring your metering method.
4. **If using API or MQTT meter feeds**, set up the data feeds before selecting "API" for the meter type. Data is expected within 11 seconds of selecting API. Test scripts are available in the test directory.
5. **For multiple SmartEVSEs**, see [Power Share setup](#multiple-smartevse-controllers-on-one-mains-supply-power-share) below.

> Solar mode was removed. Only Normal and Smart operating modes remain.

## Quick reference: menu visibility

# LCD menu settings reference

Settings are listed below in the order they appear on the LCD screen.

## MODE
By default, you are in normal EVSE mode. You can also choose smart mode, but it requires configuring a [MAINS MET](#mains-met) to function.

- **Normal**: The EV will charge with the current set at [MAX](#max).
- **Smart**: The EV will charge with a dynamic charge current, depending on [MAINS MET](#mains-met) data, [MAINS](#mains), [MAX](#max) and [MIN](#min) settings.

## CONFIG
Configure SmartEVSE with Type 2 Socket or fixed cable.

- **Socket**: The SmartEVSE is connected to a socket, so it will need to sense the cable used for its maximum capacity.
- **Fixed**: The SmartEVSE is connected to a fixed cable, and MAX will determine your maximum charge current.

## LOCK
> Visible when: CONFIG = Socket

- **Disabled**: No lock is used.
- **Solenoid**: Dostar, DUOSIDA DSIEC-ELB / ELM, or Ratio lock.
- **Motor**: Signal wire reversed, DUOSIDA DSIEC-EL or Phoenix Contact.

## PWR SHARE

## CIRCUIT
> Visible when: PWR SHARE = Master, OR (PWR SHARE = Disabled AND MODE = Smart AND EV METER configured)

Set the max current of the EVSE circuit: 10-160A per phase. When power sharing, this is the total current that will be split between connected and charging EVs.

## CircuitMeter

CircuitMeter is a third energy meter that monitors a subpanel circuit feeding the
EVSE. It provides subpanel breaker protection and circuit-level energy data for ERE
compliance. See [Features — CircuitMeter](features.md#circuitmeter--subpanel-metering)
for background.

CircuitMeter is configured via the web UI, REST API, or MQTT — it does not appear
in the LCD menu.

### CircuitMeter type

Set the meter type for the circuit meter. Uses the same meter type list as
MAINS MET and EV METER (Eastron, ABB, Finder, Orno, Custom, API, etc.).

- **0** (default): Disabled — no circuit meter, zero runtime cost.
- **1-19**: A supported Modbus energy meter type (same IDs as MAINS MET).
- **9 (API)**: Circuit meter data is fed externally via MQTT (`Set/CircuitMeter`)
  or REST API (`/currents` with `circuit_L1`, `circuit_L2`, `circuit_L3` params).

**REST API:** `circuit_meter_type` field in GET/POST `/settings`
**MQTT:** Not directly settable via MQTT (use REST API or web UI)
**NVS key:** `CircuitMeter` (uint8_t)

### CircuitMeter address

Modbus address for the circuit meter: 10-247. Only relevant when CircuitMeter type
is a Modbus meter (not Disabled or API).

- **Default:** 14

**REST API:** `circuit_meter_address` field in GET/POST `/settings`
**NVS key:** `CirMeterAddr` (uint8_t)

### MaxCircuitMains

Maximum current allowed on the subpanel circuit (sum of all phases is per-phase,
same convention as MAINS): 0-600A.

- **0** (default): Disabled — no circuit current limiting.
- **10-600**: Maximum current in Amperes per phase. SmartEVSE will reduce charging
  current so that `CircuitMeter` measured current stays below this value.

When both `MaxCircuitMains` and `MaxMains` are configured, the most restrictive
limit applies.

**REST API:** `max_circuit_mains` field in GET/POST `/settings`
**MQTT:** `Set/MaxCircuitMains` (integer, 0-600)
**NVS key:** `MaxCirMains` (uint16_t)
**HA entity:** `Max Circuit Mains` (number, settable)

## CONTACT 2
> Visible when: MODE = Smart

Use a second contactor (C2) to switch phases L2 and L3.

- **Not present**: The second contactor is not present, and SmartEVSE assumes 3-phase charging.
- **Always Off**: C2 is always off, single-phase charging.
- **Always On**: C2 is always on, three-phase charging (default).
- *(Ordinal 2, formerly "Solar Off", is reserved/unused — Solar mode was removed.)*
- **Auto**: SmartEVSE starts charging at 3-phase, and always charges at 3P in Smart mode. **Note: Auto is not available on Nodes (PWR SHARE = Node 1-7).**

**Important**: Wire your C2 contactor according to the schematics in the [Hardware installation](installation.md).

## SWITCH
Set the Function of an External Switch (Pin SW or Connector P2).

- **Disabled**: A push button can be used to stop charging.
- **Access B**: A momentary push button is used to enable/disable access to the charging station.
- **Access S**: A toggle switch is used to enable/disable access to the charging station.
- *(Values 3/4, formerly "Sma-Sol B/S" mode-toggle switches, are reserved/unused — Solar mode was removed.)*
- **Grid Relay**: A relay from your energy provider is connected; when the relay is open, power usage is limited to 4.2kW (Energy Industry Act, par 14a). **Note: Grid Relay is not available on Nodes (PWR SHARE = Node 1-7).**
- **Custom B**: A momentary push button can be used for external integrations.
- **Custom S**: A toggle switch can be used for external integrations.

## LED MODE
Select the LED color scheme.

- **Standard** — Default color scheme: green/smart-color for charging, red for errors. Custom colors can be set via MQTT.
- **Public** — Public charging station scheme, OCPP-aware. Green (dim) = Available, Blue (static) = EV connected, Blue (fading) = Charging, Orange = Reserved, Red = Faulted / Unavailable. RFID read produces a short grey flash; authorization result produces a short green (granted) or red (rejected/timeout) flash. Best used with OCPP enabled.

## RCMON
Residual Current Monitor (RCM14-03) plugged into connector P1.

- **Disabled**: The RCD option is not used.
- **Enabled**: When a fault current is detected, the contactor will be opened.

# Setup guides by role

## Single SmartEVSE (standalone)

1. Set **PWR SHARE** = Disabled
2. Set **CONFIG** (Socket or Fixed) and **LOCK** if using a socket
3. Set **MAX** to the maximum current your cable/installation supports
4. Set **WIFI**, **SWITCH**, **RCMON**, **RFID** as needed for your hardware
5. If you only need Normal mode, you are done
6. For Smart mode: set **MODE**, then configure **MAINS MET** and the settings that appear (MAINS, MIN, etc.)
7. For single-phase charging: set **CONTACT 2** = Always Off

## Master setup (Power Share)

1. Set **PWR SHARE** = Master
2. Set **MODE** to Smart with a Sensorbox or configured kWh meter
3. Configure **MAINS MET** and **MAINS** (maximum current of the mains connection per phase)
4. Set **CIRCUIT** to the maximum current of the EVSE circuit per phase (shared between EVs)
5. Set **MAX** for the EV connected to this SmartEVSE
6. Set **MIN** to the lowest allowable charging current for all connected EVs
7. Configure remaining hardware settings (WIFI, SWITCH, RCMON, RFID, etc.)
8. Optionally configure **PRIORITY**, **ROTATION**, and **IDLE TMO** for [priority scheduling](priority-scheduling.md) — these control what happens when there isn't enough power for all EVSEs

## Node setup (Power Share)

Nodes have a reduced menu. Most metering and balancing settings are managed by the Master.

1. Set **PWR SHARE** = Node 1-7 (unique number for each Node)
2. Set **MAX** for the EV connected to this SmartEVSE
3. Optionally configure **EV METER** if this Node has its own EV meter
4. Configure hardware settings (CONFIG, LOCK, SWITCH, RCMON, RFID, WIFI, etc.)

**Note**: The following restrictions apply to Nodes:
- SWITCH: the Grid Relay option is not available
- CONTACT 2: the Auto option is not available
- Settings managed by the Master (MAINS MET, MAINS, MIN, CIRCUIT, CAPACITY, custom meter configuration) do not appear in the Node menu

# SINGLE PHASE CHARGING

SmartEVSE calculates with currents per phase; a problem arises in Smart mode, because there Isum (the sum of the currents of all phases) has to be guarded; to calculate with it per phase you have to know the number of phases you are charging.
We try to detect the number of phases you are charging with, with the help of the settings of the second contactor C2 and the EVMeter, if present.
This detection can fail easily; not always an EVMeter is present, and even if there is, an EV could determine to start charging at one phase and later on add more phases (Teslas are known to do this); an EV could even decide during the charging process to stop charging on certain phases.
We could introduce a setting "1phase/3phase" charging, but this setting would be EV dependent if you are on a 3 phase grid; so you would have to change the setting every time another EV connects to your SmartEVSE.

Currently the most reliable way to get the correct behaviour in Smart mode is:
- if you are on a 3 phase grid and you are 3 phase charging, you have no problem
- if you are on a 3 phase grid and you are 1 phase charging in Smart mode, set CONTACT2 to "Always Off", even if you don't have a second contactor installed; it will tell the algorithm to calculate with single phase
- if you are on a 1 phase grid, set CONTACT2 to "Always Off" since you will always be charging single phase

# Multiple SmartEVSE controllers on one mains supply (Power Share)
Up to eight SmartEVSE modules can share one mains supply.

## Hardware connections
- Connect the A, B and GND connections from the Master to the Node(s).
- So A connects to A, B goes to B etc.
- If you are using Smart mode, you should connect the A, B, +12V and GND wires from the sensorbox to the same screw terminals of the SmartEVSE! Make sure that the +12V wire from the sensorbox is connected to only -one- SmartEVSE.

## Software configuration
- Set one SmartEVSE PWR SHARE setting to MASTER, and the others to NODE 1-7. Make sure there is only one Master, and the Node numbers are unique.
- See [Master setup](#master-setup-power-share) and [Node setup](#node-setup-power-share) above for step-by-step instructions.

# OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol)

Connect your charge point to a backend server. This allows you to use the SmartEVSE as a public charging station, or to bill a company or user for electricity costs.

## Setup

You will need a Backend Provider (BP) that supports the **OCPP 1.6j** protocol. The BP monitors your charger usage, bills the appropriate user and/or company, and pays you your share.

1. Configure the OCPP connection in the **OCPP section** of the SmartEVSE dashboard (identifiers, server URL, credentials).
2. Configure an [EV METER](#ev-meter) to measure the energy supplied to the car.
3. To use the **RFID reader** with OCPP, set the [RFID](#rfid) mode to **Rmt/OCPP**. Note that other RFID modes override OCPP access control.

## Requirements and limitations

- If the backend uses **OCPP SmartCharging** the SmartEVSE internal power sharing [PWR SHARE](#pwr-share) has to be turned off.

For user experiences with backend providers, see [OCPP Backends](ocpp.md).

# REST API

For the specification of the REST API, see [REST API](REST_API.md)

# MQTT API
Your SmartEVSE can now export the most important data to your MQTT-server. Just fill in the configuration data on the webserver and the data will automatically be announced to your MQTT server.

You can easily show all the MQTT topics published:
```
mosquitto_sub -v -h ip-of-mosquitto-server -u username -P password  -t '#'
```

You can feed the SmartEVSE data by publishing to a topic:
```
mosquitto_pub  -h ip-of-mosquitto-server -u username -P password -t 'SmartEVSE-xxxxx/Set/CurrentOverride' -m 150
```
...where xxxxx your SmartEVSE's serial number, will set your Override Current to 15.0A.

Valid topics you can publish to are:
```
/Set/Mode
/Set/CurrentOverride
/Set/CurrentMaxSumMains
/Set/CPPWMOverride
/Set/MainsMeter
/Set/EVMeter
/Set/HomeBatteryCurrent
/Set/RequiredEVCCID
/Set/ColorOff
/Set/ColorNormal
/Set/ColorSmart
/Set/CableLock
/Set/EnableC2  0 "Not present", 1 "Always Off", 2 "Reserved" (unused), 3 "Always On", 4 "Auto" ; do not change during charging to prevent unexpected errors of your EV!
               You can send either the number or the string, SmartEVSE will accept both!
/Set/RFID      Hex string representing RFID card UID (12 or 14 hex characters for 6 or 7 byte UIDs)
               Example: "112233445566" (6 bytes) or "11223344556677" (7 bytes)
               This will simulate an RFID card swipe and start/stop a charging session using all existing RFID checks
               (whitelist verification, OCPP authorization, etc.)
/Set/PrioStrategy       0=Modbus Address, 1=First Connected, 2=Last Connected (Master only)
/Set/RotationInterval   0=disabled, 30-1440 minutes (Master only)
/Set/IdleTimeout        30-300 seconds (Master only)
```

Your mains kWh meter data can be fed with:
```
mosquitto_pub  -h ip-of-mosquitto-server -u username -P password -t 'SmartEVSE-xxxxx/Set/MainsMeter' -m L1:L2:L3
```
...where L1 - L3 are the currents in deci-Amperes. So 100 means 10.0A importing, -5 means 0.5A exporting.
...These should be fed at least every 10 seconds.

Your EV kWh meter data can be fed with:
```
mosquitto_pub  -h ip-of-mosquitto-server -u username -P password -t 'SmartEVSE-xxxxx/Set/EVMeter' -m L1:L2:L3:P:E
```
...where L1 - L3 are the currents in deci-Amperes. So 100 means 10.0A.
...where P is the Power in W,
...where E is the Energy in Wh.

You can simulate an RFID card swipe via MQTT to start/stop a charging session:
```
mosquitto_pub  -h ip-of-mosquitto-server -u username -P password -t 'SmartEVSE-xxxxx/Set/RFID' -m '112233445566'
```
...where 112233445566 is the hex representation of your RFID card's UID (6 byte example).
...For a 7 byte UID, use 14 hex characters (e.g., '11223344556677').
...The RFID will be processed using all existing checks: whitelist verification, OCPP authorization, etc.
...Swiping the same card again will typically stop the session (behavior depends on RFID Reader mode setting).

You can find test scripts in the [test directory](https://github.com/SmartEVSE/SmartEVSE-3/tree/master/SmartEVSE-3/test) that feed EV and MainsMeter data to your MQTT server.

The `/Set/CurrentMaxSumMains` topic can be used to set the [CAPACITY](#capacity) setting.

# Home Battery Integration
In a normal EVSE setup, a sensorbox is used to read the P1 information to deduce how much power is available for grid-import optimization in Smart mode. This however can give unwanted results when also using a home battery as this will result in one battery charging the other one.

For this purpose the settings endpoint allows you to pass through the battery current information:
* A positive current means the battery is charging
* A negative current means the battery is discharging

**Regular updates from the consumer are required to keep this working as values cannot be older than 11 seconds.**

> Solar mode, the only mode that used the home battery current to neutralize the impact of a home battery on the P1 information, was removed. `/Set/HomeBatteryCurrent` is still accepted for compatibility, but the value is currently not applied to any calculation.

# Integration with Home Assistant
There are three options to integrate your SmartEVSE with Home Assistant:

## By MQTT (preferred)

If you already use MQTT in your Home Assistant setup, this is the easiest and fastest way to integrate your SmartEVSE into HA. As soon as you have MQTT configured correctly in the SmartEVSE, the device will automatically be discovered by Home Assistant!

> [!TIP]
> Just add the MQTT details in the SmartEVSE and you're good! There is no further integration needed to set up, you will find the SmartEVSE listed on the [MQTT integration page](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=mqtt). Not even a HA restart needed!

## Through the HA-integration - DEPRECATED

If you cannot (or do not want to) use MQTT to integrate your SmartEVSE with Home Assistant, please have a look at [the SmartEVSE `custom_component` for Home Assistant](https://github.com/dingo35/ha-SmartEVSEv3). This `custom_component` uses the REST API to share data from the SmartEVSE to Home Assistant, and enables you to set SmartEVSE settings from Home Assistant. You will need SmartEVSE firmware version 1.5.2 or higher to use this integration.

> [!WARNING]
>  Because of how this `custom_component` and the REST API works, data updates will arrive considerably slower in HA when compared to the MQTT integration. When possible, consider using MQTT.

## By manually configuring your configuration.yaml

It's a lot of work, but you can have everything exactly your way. See examples in the integrations directory of our GitHub repository.

# EU Capacity Rate Limiting

In line with a EU directive, electricity providers can implement a "capacity rate" for consumers, encouraging more balanced energy consumption. This approach aims to smooth out usage patterns and reduce peak demand.

For further details, please refer to [serkri#215](https://github.com/serkri/SmartEVSE-3/issues/215).

* The menu item "Capacity" can be set from 10-600A. (sum of all phases)
* This setting applies only in Smart mode.
* Beyond existing limits (Mains, MaxCircuit), the charging current will be controlled to ensure that the total of all Mains phase currents does not exceed the Capacity setting.
* If you are unfamiliar with this setting or do not fall under the applicable regulations, it is advisable to keep the setting at its default setting. (disabled)

## Capacity Tariff Peak Tracking (CapacityLimit)

For users under the Belgian capaciteitstarief or similar EU peak-based billing,
SmartEVSE can track 15-minute average power and automatically reduce charging
current to stay below a configured peak limit.

| Setting | Channel | Range | Default | Persisted |
|---------|---------|-------|---------|-----------|
| CapacityLimit | LCD, Web, MQTT, REST | 0-25000 W (0-25.0 kW) | 0 (disabled) | Yes (NVS) |

- **0** (default): Feature disabled. No peak tracking or current limiting.
- **1-25000** (watts): Maximum allowed 15-minute average power for the household.
  When the running average approaches this limit, the EVSE reduces charge current
  to maintain headroom.

**How it works:**

1. Every second, SmartEVSE accumulates total mains power (sum of all phases).
2. Every 15 minutes, it calculates the average power for that window.
3. If the running average within a window approaches `CapacityLimit`, the EVSE
   reduces `IsetBalanced` to prevent exceeding the target.
4. The highest 15-minute average each month is recorded as the monthly peak and
   persisted in NVS. On month rollover, the peak resets.

**Setting via LCD:**

Navigate to **CAP PEAK** in the LCD menu (visible when a mains meter is
configured and Load Balancing is Disabled or Master). The display shows the
limit in kW with 0.1 kW steps (0 = Disabled, 0.1-25.0 kW).

**Setting via Web UI:**

Open the **Capacity Tariff** card in the web interface. Enter the peak limit
in kW and click **Set**. The card also shows the current 15-minute window
average, monthly peak, and available headroom.

**Setting via MQTT:**
```bash
mosquitto_pub -t "SmartEVSE-xxxxx/Set/CapacityLimit" -m 5000
```

**Setting via REST API:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://smartevse-xxxx.local/settings -d "capacity_limit=5000"
```

**Note:** This feature complements the existing CAPACITY setting (which limits
total mains current in amps). CapacityLimit works in watts with 15-minute
averaging for peak billing optimization. Both constraints are enforced
simultaneously.

MQTT) can read or write it, whether it persists across reboots, and which are
