# Differences from the reference codebase

This is a maintainer-facing document describing how this firmware
diverges from the [reference codebase
(`dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5`)](https://github.com/dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5).
It is intended for contributors deciding whether a behaviour, fix, or
feature originates here or upstream, and for porting changes between
the two.

For end-user feature documentation see [Features](features.md). For
operational guidance see the audience guides
([installer](guide-installer.md), [owner](guide-owner.md),
[integrator](guide-integrator.md)).

## Architecture changes

Structural changes that affect the entire codebase — not specific features.

| Change | Reference state | This codebase |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| State machine location | Inline in `main.cpp` (~3,000 lines) | Extracted to `evse_state_machine.c` (pure C) |
| State representation | ~70 scattered globals | `evse_ctx_t` context struct |
| Hardware abstraction | Direct GPIO calls in logic | Function pointers via HAL callbacks |
| Global synchronization | No protection | `evse_bridge.cpp` with spinlock/mutex |
| Native testability | Not possible (Arduino dependencies) | 1,096 tests compile with plain `gcc` |
| CI pipeline | PlatformIO build only | 10-job pipeline (tests, sanitizers, valgrind, cppcheck, builds, BDD, traceability, OCPP, Modbus) |
| Test methodology | None | Specification-by-Example (SbE) with traceability |

## Feature Differences by Area

### Smart & Solar Mode

Background — community reports:
[#327](https://github.com/dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5/issues/327),
[#335](https://github.com/dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5/issues/335),
[#316](https://github.com/dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5/issues/316).

| Improvement | Why | Details |
|-------------|-----|---------|
| EMA current smoothing | Oscillation in smart/solar modes | [Features: Solar & Smart Mode](features.md#solar--smart-mode) |
| Dead band regulation | Micro-adjustments cause unnecessary switching | [Features: Solar & Smart Mode](features.md#solar--smart-mode) |
| Symmetric ramp rates | Overshoot/undershoot from asymmetric regulation | [Features: Solar & Smart Mode](features.md#solar--smart-mode) |

| Multi-node SolarStopTimer fix | Upstream threshold scales with `ActiveEVSE`, unreachable for 2+ nodes (commit `94ca08e`). Upstream attempted a different fix in `02dafa2` that we evaluated and rejected — it reproduces the multi-node scaling bug and causes stop/start cycling for fixed 3-phase. See [analysis](upstream-sync/analysis-02dafa2-solar-stop-threshold.md). | [PR #119](https://github.com/basmeerman/SmartEVSE-3.5/pull/119) |
| Slave mode sync via setMode() | Upstream `SETITEM(MENU_MODE)` skips phase switching and error clearing on slaves | [PR #121](https://github.com/basmeerman/SmartEVSE-3.5/pull/121) |
| Slow EV compatibility | Renault Zoe stalls on rapid current changes | [Features: Solar & Smart Mode](features.md#solar--smart-mode) |
| ChargeDelay re-set on solar loss | Solar mode ChargeDelay could expire without solar, causing charging-without-solar oscillation — integrated upstream `74e20c8` (master) + `3ab1cee` (node-side) with 3 unit tests | upstream `74e20c8`, `3ab1cee` |

### Load Balancing

Background — community report:

| EMA filter on Idifference | Measurement noise causes false triggers | [Features: Load Balancing](features.md#load-balancing--power-sharing) |

| 126 convergence tests | Algorithm changes blocked by regression risk | [Features: Load Balancing](features.md#load-balancing--power-sharing) |
| CAPACITY fluctuation fix | `MaxSumMains` overwrote per-phase Idifference with a sum-of-phases value, causing current fluctuations when the EU capacity limit was configured — integrated upstream `a54b07f` (fixes #327) with 3 unit tests | upstream `a54b07f` |

| Improvement | Why | Details |
|-------------|-----|---------|
| RFID toggle bug fix | Next RFID swipe toggles OFF instead of ON after Tesla disconnect | [Features: OCPP & Authorization](features.md#rfid-ocpp--authorization) |

| IEC 61851 → OCPP status mapping | EVCC integration needs standard status codes | [Features: OCPP & Authorization](features.md#rfid-ocpp--authorization) |
| Silent OCPP session loss recovery | WebSocket pings keep transport alive but don't prove backend is processing OCPP messages — integrated upstream `ecd088b` with timing logic extracted to pure C and 10 unit tests | upstream `ecd088b` |
| Atomic connector lock decision | Upstream `ocppLoop()` briefly flipped `OcppForcesLock` false→true within one iteration, causing actuator unlock/relock jitter — integrated upstream `05c7fc2` with the decision extracted to pure C and 11 unit tests | upstream `05c7fc2` |
| OCPP Finishing-before-Available sequence | CSMS missed the Finishing state because OccupiedInput went false immediately after StopTx — integrated upstream `afd72a8` with the decision extracted to pure C (`ocpp_should_report_occupied`) and 6 unit tests | upstream `afd72a8` |
| Cable disconnect detection under PAUSE | CP sampling timer left disabled after STATE_B single-shot fired — integrated upstream `e6110b1` (timerAlarmEnable in STATE_A/STATE_C1 paths) | upstream `e6110b1` |
| Public charging station LED scheme | Public-charger color semantics (available/connected/charging/reserved/faulted) selectable via new `LedMode` menu — integrated upstream `3679fe3` with the decision tree extracted to pure C (`led_public_compute()`) and 14 unit tests. Fork keeps `MENU_LEDMODE=51` to avoid renumber cascade. | upstream `3679fe3` |

### Security Hardening (Fork-only)

Findings from the security review (see internal report; most issues are inherited from upstream).

| Fix | Why | Details |
|-----|-----|---------|
| Unsigned firmware upload rejected at `POST /update` | Upstream accepts `firmware.bin` / `firmware.debug.bin` uploads over unauthenticated HTTP with no signature check → any LAN client can flash arbitrary firmware (unauthenticated RCE). Fork accepts only `*.signed.bin` — verified via the multi-key RSA validator from PR #125 | Security fix C-1 |
| OCPP auth_key never exposed via `/settings` GET | Upstream returns the plaintext OCPP backend basic-auth key to any client calling `GET /settings`. Fork emits only `auth_key_set: bool` and the Web UI shows a placeholder | Security fix C-2 |
| MQTT private password redacted from boot log | Upstream logs the full EC-private-key-hash on every boot. Fork logs a 4-char prefix then `[redacted]` | Security fix C-5 |
| `strncpy(RequiredEVCCID, ...)` always NUL-terminated | Upstream pattern leaves the buffer unterminated when source fills it; subsequent `%s` walks past end | Security fix H-5 |
| OCPP URL validator rejects SSRF targets | Upstream accepts `wss://127.0.0.1/`, `wss://[::1]/`, `wss://169.254.x/`, `wss://user:pass@host/`. Fork rejects loopback + link-local + embedded credentials. RFC1918 still allowed for self-hosted CSMS | Security fix H-4 |
| Full partition erase on signature failure | Upstream erases only the first `ENCRYPTED_BLOCK_SIZE` (4 KB) on sig-fail, leaving >4 KB of attacker bytes in flash. Fork erases the entire partition | Security fix M-4 |
| Hash buffer zeroed before free in `validate_sig` | Hygiene: keeps debug-memory dumps from trivially revealing the firmware fingerprint | Security fix M-3 |
| Opt-in HTTP auth layer (`AuthMode` NVS setting) | Upstream has no authentication on any HTTP endpoint. Fork adds `AuthMode` (0=Off legacy default, 1=Required) with a pure-C decision helper, LCD-PIN reuse, 30-min idle session timeout, Origin-based CSRF, and applied to every mutating endpoint + `GET /settings`. **Default 0 on upgrade so no install is bricked.** Integrations (HA / custom scripts) continue to work unchanged; security-conscious users explicitly opt in | Plan 16 — Phase 1 — closes C-3, H-1, H-2, H-3, H-7, M-1, M-2, M-8 when enabled |

## Contributing changes to the reference codebase

When porting a change to the reference codebase
(`dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5`):

- **Submit small, focused PRs** — the upstream maintainer is
  conservative about large changes.
- **Do not bundle test infrastructure with feature changes** — the
  reference codebase has a different test approach; bundling slows
  review.
- **Follow the reference codebase's conventions** — naming, commit
  style, and code organisation differ.
- **Rewrite the commit message in plain technical English** — strip
  AI-generated tone (no "Co-Authored-By: Claude" trailers, no
  multi-paragraph rationale unless the maintainer asks).
- **Never modify other-owned repos without explicit user approval.**
