## Charging (Core)

SmartEVSE is a versatile EVSE controller that works with all EVs and plug-in
hybrids:

- **1-3 phase charging** — fixed cable or socket with locking actuator (5 types
  supported)
- **Automatic cable detection** — selects current capacity of the connected
  cable (13/16/32A) via proximity pilot (PP) resistance
- **Dual contactor outputs** — two switched 230VAC outputs enable automatic
  1-phase to 3-phase switching
- **RS485 communication bus** — powered bus for Sensorbox and Modbus kWh meters
- **Thermal protection** — built-in temperature sensor with automatic current
  reduction and shutdown
- **Wide input voltage** — operates on 110-240 VAC
- **Compact form factor** — 52 × 91 × 58 mm (3 DIN modules)

## Solar & Smart Mode

### Smart Mode

Automatically adjusts charge current based on other household consumption to
stay within mains capacity. Reads real-time consumption from the mains meter
(Modbus, Sensorbox, HomeWizard P1, or API) and calculates available headroom.

### Solar Mode

Charges from solar surplus with configurable start/stop thresholds and import
allowance. Supports automatic 1P/3P phase switching based on available power
(requires CONTACT 2 wiring).

### Stability behaviour

Background — community reports that motivated the work:
[#327](https://github.com/dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5/issues/327),
[#335](https://github.com/dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5/issues/335),
[#316](https://github.com/dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5/issues/316).

- **EMA current smoothing** — configurable exponential moving average filter
  dampens oscillation by smoothing noisy meter readings. Higher alpha values
  respond faster but smooth less; lower values are more stable but slower.
- **Dead band regulation** — suppresses micro-adjustments when the current
  difference is within a configurable band (e.g., ±0.5A). Prevents unnecessary
  contactor cycling from measurement noise.
- **Symmetric ramp rates** — equal ramp-up and ramp-down speeds prevent the
  overshoot/undershoot oscillation caused by an asymmetric regulation profile
  (fast up, slow down).
- **Tiered phase switching timers** — separate fast timer for severe overload
  (e.g., 30s) and configurable hold-down guard (e.g., 5 minutes) to prevent
  rapid 1P/3P cycling.
- **Stop/start cycling prevention** — higher NoCurrent threshold, gradual
  current decay before stopping, solar minimum run time, and shorter solar
  charge delay reduce unnecessary stop/start cycles.
- **Slow EV compatibility** — settling window and ramp rate limiter for EVs
  like the Renault Zoe that stall on rapid current changes.

## Load Balancing & Power Sharing

Up to 8 SmartEVSEs share one mains connection without overloading it. Supports
priority-based power scheduling with configurable rotation intervals and
delayed charging.

### Stability behaviour

Background — see [#316](https://github.com/dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5/issues/316).

- **Oscillation dampening** — detects current hunting via sign-flip detection
  on Idifference, adaptively increases the regulation divisor to slow down
  adjustments until the system stabilizes.
- **EMA filter on Idifference** — exponential moving average (25% alpha)
  smooths measurement noise from current transducers, reducing false regulation
  triggers while preserving convergence speed.
- **Distribution smoothing** — per-EVSE delta clamping limits current changes
  to max 3.0A per cycle, preventing contactor stress and EV charge controller
  destabilization from sudden jumps.
- **Load balancing diagnostic snapshot** — per-cycle diagnostic struct captures
  IsetBalanced, filtered Idifference, baseload, per-EVSE allocations,
  oscillation count, and shortage/clamping flags. Available via MQTT for
  debugging.
- **126 convergence tests** — multi-cycle simulation test suite covering 2-8
  node configurations, priority scheduling under shortage, node join/leave
  transitions, and vehicle response lag modeling.

## RFID, OCPP & Authorization

### Base Features

- **RFID reader** — restrict usage to up to 100 registered cards
- **OCPP 1.6j** — backend authorization with Tap Electric, Tibber, SteVe, Monta

### Behaviour notes

- **Fixed RFID toggle bug** — `AccessStatus` is now cleared on all disconnect
  paths (including Tesla C→B→A), preventing the next RFID swipe from toggling
  OFF instead of ON.
- **Bridge transaction mutex** — FreeRTOS mutex prevents concurrent task
  corruption of the state context, fixing daily OCPP session failures after
  Tesla disconnects.
- **Pure C OCPP logic extraction** — authorization decisions, connector state
  detection, RFID formatting, and settings validation extracted to
  `ocpp_logic.c` for native testability (85 OCPP-specific tests).
- **LoadBl exclusivity enforcement** — OCPP Smart Charging and internal load
  balancing are mutually exclusive; now enforced at runtime with warnings when
  conflict detected (previously only checked at init).
- **FreeVend solar safety** — auto-authorize (FreeVend) no longer bypasses
  solar surplus checks or ChargeDelay, preventing charging without sunlight.
- **OCPP settings validation** — backend URL (`ws://`/`wss://`), ChargeBoxId
  (max 20 chars, printable ASCII), and auth key validated before passing to
  MicroOcpp library.
- **OCPP connection telemetry** — WebSocket connect/disconnect counters,
  transaction lifecycle tracking, authorization accept/reject/timeout metrics.
- **IEC 61851 → OCPP status mapping** — maps IEC states to OCPP 1.6
  StatusNotification values (Available, Preparing, Charging, SuspendedEV/EVSE,
  Finishing, Faulted).

  compatibility.
- **New entities** — MaxSumMains (settable), FreeHeap, MQTTMsgCount, LoadBl,
  PairingPin, FirmwareVersion (diagnostic).
- **Per-phase power via MQTT** — 6 new topics (`MainsPowerL1/L2/L3`,
  `EVPowerL1/L2/L3`) with HA auto-discovery.
- **Per-phase energy via MQTT** — 6 new topics for per-phase energy data with
  HA auto-discovery (`state_class=total_increasing`).

- **Pure C Modbus frame decoder** — `ModbusDecode()` extracted to
  `modbus_decode.c` for native testability, supporting FC03/04/06/10 and
  exception frames.
- **Pure C meter byte decoder** — `combineBytes()` and `decodeMeasurement()`
  extracted to `meter_decode.c`, covering all 4 endianness modes and 3 data

  frames with address, function code, register, and timestamp.
- **API/MQTT staleness detection** — configurable timeout (default 120s) for
  API-fed mains current; falls back to MaxMains on expiry.
- **HomeWizard P1 energy data** — reads `total_power_import_kwh` /
  `total_power_export_kwh` for the HA energy dashboard.
- **HomeWizard P1 manual IP fallback** — `Set/HomeWizardIP` MQTT command
  bypasses mDNS discovery for unreliable networks.

## EVCC Integration

REST API integration with [EVCC](https://evcc.io/) energy management system.
WiFi-only setup — no RS485 Modbus wiring required.

### Behaviour notes

- **IEC 61851-1 state mapping** — pure C function maps internal SmartEVSE
  states to standard IEC 61851 letters (A-F), with correct soft/hard error
  distinction.
- **Phase switching via HTTP** — `POST /settings?phases=1|3` triggers safe
  1P/3P switching with full validation.
- **Charging state derivation** — `charging_enabled` boolean in GET /settings
  response, derived from STATE_C/STATE_C1.
- **Ready-to-use EVCC template** — complete `evcc.yaml` custom charger
  template included in documentation.

## Capacity Tariff Peak Tracking



European capacity tariff structures -- such as the Belgian Fluvius
capaciteitstarief (live since January 2023) and the German par14a EnWG --
charge consumers based on their peak power demand rather than total
consumption. The Belgian model bills based on the highest 15-minute average
power in each month, at approximately EUR 57/kW/year.

SmartEVSE now tracks these peaks and automatically limits charging current to
avoid setting new monthly highs:

- **15-minute quarter-peak averaging** -- accumulates watt-seconds every second
  and computes the rolling average power at the end of each 15-minute window,
  matching the Belgian DSO metering interval.
- **Monthly peak tracking** -- records the highest 15-minute average each month.
  Peaks are persisted in NVS and reset automatically on month rollover.
- **Automatic charging current reduction** -- calculates headroom (how many
  watts remain before the configured limit) and clamps `IsetBalanced` so the
  EVSE never pushes the household above the target. Works alongside the
  existing `MaxSumMains` enforcement path.
- **Configurable limit** -- set the capacity limit (in watts, 0 = disabled) via
  the LCD menu (**CAP PEAK**, 0-25.0 kW in 0.1 kW steps), the web UI
  (**Capacity Tariff** card), MQTT (`Set/CapacityLimit`), REST API, or Home
  Assistant. A limit of 0 disables the feature entirely.
- **Home Assistant integration** -- four auto-discovered entities:
  `CapacityLimit` (settable number), `CapacityWindowAvg` (sensor),
  `CapacityMonthlyPeak` (sensor), and `CapacityHeadroom` (sensor), all with
  `device_class: power` and unit W.

## CircuitMeter — Subpanel Metering



A third energy meter instance for monitoring subpanel circuits. CircuitMeter
addresses two needs:

- **Subpanel breaker protection** — limits EV charging current so the total
  subpanel load stays below the breaker rating (`MaxCircuitMains`). Without this,
  other loads on the same subpanel (heat pump, dryer) can cause the breaker to trip
  during charging.
- **ERE 2027 compliance support** — provides circuit-level energy measurement for
  Dutch ERE Path B verification. If `circuit_kwh` matches `session_kwh` in the
  session log, the circuit exclusively feeds the charger.

**Key design points:**

- Reuses the existing `Meter` class — supports all 19 meter types (Eastron, ABB,
  Finder, Orno, Custom, etc.) with zero new meter code
- Zero runtime cost when disabled (`CircuitMeter` type = 0, the default)
- Integrates with load balancing: `MaxCircuitMains` acts as an additional current
  constraint alongside `MaxMains` and `MaxCircuit`
- Full MQTT + Home Assistant auto-discovery for circuit current, power, and energy
- API/MQTT external feed supported (`Set/CircuitMeter` with `L1:L2:L3` format)

**Typical wiring:**

```
Grid meter ─── Main panel ─── [CircuitMeter] ─── Subpanel
                   │                                 ├── EVSE (EVMeter)
                   │                                 └── Other loads (heat pump, etc.)
                   ├── Kitchen
                   └── Lighting
```

## ERE Session Logging


([PR #89](https://github.com/basmeerman/SmartEVSE-3.5/pull/89))

- **Charge session tracking** — automatic session recording on every charge
  cycle with start/end timestamps, energy charged (kWh), peak current, phases,
  and mode.
- **ERE-compatible output** — JSON format includes all fields required for
  Dutch ERE (Emissie Reductie Eenheden) certificate submission.
- **MQTT session publish** — retained JSON message on `<prefix>/Session/Complete`
  on session end.
- **REST endpoint** — `GET /session/last` returns the last completed session.
- **OCPP alignment** — sessions flagged when OCPP manages the transaction.
- **Zero flash wear** — MQTT-only persistence; no flash writes.
