# GET: /settings

curl -X GET http://ipaddress/settings

will give output like:
```
{"version":"21:02:46 @Jan  3 2024","mode":"OFF","mode_id":0,"car_connected":false,"wifi":{"status":"WL_CONNECTED","ssid":"wifi_nomap_EXT","rssi":-82,"bssid":"28:87:BA:D6:B9:DE"},"evse":{"temp":16,"temp_max":60,"connected":false,"access":false,"mode":1,"loadbl":0,"pwm":1024,"state":"Ready to Charge","state_id":0,"error":"None","error_id":0,"rfid":"Not Installed"},"settings":{"charge_current":0,"override_current":0,"current_min":6,"current_max":16,"current_main":25,"current_max_circuit":16,"current_max_sum_mains":600,"enable_C2":"Always On","modem":"Not present","mains_meter":"InvEastrn","starttime":0,"stoptime":0,"repeat":0},"mqtt":{"host":"10.0.0.28","port":1883,"topic_prefix":"SmartEVSE-51446","username":"homeassistant","password_set":true,"status":"Connected"},"home_battery":{"current":0,"last_update":0},"ev_meter":{"description":"Eastron3P","address":11,"import_active_power":0,"total_kwh":5670.1,"charged_kwh":0,"currents":{"TOTAL":1,"L1":0,"L2":0,"L3":1},"import_active_energy":5670.1,"export_active_energy":0},"mains_meter":{"import_active_energy":8614.8,"export_active_energy":5289.3},"phase_currents":{"TOTAL":75,"L1":57,"L2":6,"L3":12,"last_data_update":1704535684,"charging_L1":false,"charging_L2":false,"charging_L3":false,"original_data":{"TOTAL":75,"L1":57,"L2":6,"L3":12}},"backlight":{"timer":0,"status":"OFF"}}

This output is often used to add to your bug report, so the developers can see your configuration.

NOTE:
In the http world, GET parameters are passed like this:
curl -X GET http://ipaddress/endpoint?param1=value1&param2=value2
and POST parameters are passed like this:
curl -X POST http://ipaddress/endpoint -d 'param1=value1' -d 'param2=value2' -d ''

Now in the ESP world, we all have picked up the habit of using the GET way of passing parameters also for POST commands. SmartEVSE development not excluded....
From version v3.6.0 on, instead of using the Arduino Core webserver libraries, we are now using the Mongoose webserver, which is broadly used. This webserver however sticks to the "normal" http standards.

This means that if you POST a request to SmartEVSE > 3.6.0, the webserver will be waiting for the -d data until it times out (or you ctrl-C your curl command). -d ''
You can prevent this by adding
'''
-d ''
'''

to your curl POST command. -d ''

# POST: /settings
* backlight

&emsp;&emsp;Turns backlight on (1) or off (0) for the duration of the backlighttimer.

```
    curl -X POST http://ipaddress/settings?backlight=1 -d ''
```

* mode

&emsp;&emsp;Only following values are permitted:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;0: OFF
<br>&emsp;&emsp;1: NORMAL
<br>&emsp;&emsp;2: SMART
<br>&emsp;&emsp;4: PAUSE

* disable_override_current

&emsp;&emsp;If this parameter is passed the override current will be reset (value doesn't matter)

* override_current

&emsp;&emsp;Works only when using NORMAL or SMART mode
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Desired current multiplied by 10
<br>&emsp;&emsp;If set to 0, override_current is disabled

<br>&emsp;&emsp;Examples:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;If the desired current is 8.3A the value to be sent is 83
```
    curl -X POST http://ipaddress/settings?override_current=83 -d ''
```

* enable_C2

&emsp;&emsp;Enables switching between 1 phase mode and 3 phase mode by controlling a 2nd contactor (C2 port)
<br>&emsp;&emsp;
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Note 1: The 2nd contactor will only be turned ON when state changes to C (Charging)
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Note 2: This is just changing the config setting, the contactor will not be controlled immediately but only when there is a
<br>&emsp;&emsp;state change.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;
<br>&emsp;&emsp;If car is charging and you want to change from 1P to 3P or vice versa:
```
  - Change mode to OFF
  - Enable or disable C2 contactor
  - Change to desired value: 0 "Not present", 1 "Always Off", 3 "Always On", 4 "Auto" (value 2 is reserved/unused)
  - Examples:
  - If the desired C2 mode is "Always On", the string to be sent is 3
```

* phases

&emsp;&emsp;Request a phase switch between 1-phase and 3-phase charging.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Only values 1 and 3 are accepted.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Requirements:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;- C2 contactor must be present (enable_C2 != 0 "Not present")
<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Only works on Master or standalone (PWR SHARE = Disabled or Master)
<br>&emsp;&emsp;
<br>&emsp;&emsp;The state machine handles the safe disconnect-switch-reconnect sequence automatically.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;If the requested phase count matches the current phase count, no switching occurs.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Response includes switching status:
```json
    {"phases": 1, "switching": true, "previous_phases": 3}
```
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Examples:
```
    curl -X POST 'http://ipaddress/settings?phases=1' -d ''
    curl -X POST 'http://ipaddress/settings?phases=3' -d ''
```
* starttime

&emsp;&emsp;Enables delayed charging; always has to be combined with sending the mode in which you want to start charging.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Note 1: The time string has to be in the format "2023-04-14T23:31".
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Note 2: The time must be in the future, in local time.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Examples:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;If you want the car to start charging at 23:31 on April 14th 2023, in Smart mode, the strings to be sent are:

```
    curl -X POST 'http://ipaddress/settings?starttime="2023-04-14T23:31"&mode=3' -d ''
```

* current_min

&emsp;&emsp;The Minimum Charging Current in Ampères, per phase.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Usually you should leave this setting at its default value (6A) since this is standarized. 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Note: This setting is useful for EV's that don't obey standards, like the Renault Zoe, whose MinCurrents not only differ
<br>&emsp;&emsp;from the standard, but also change when charging at 1 phase and charging at 2 phases.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;The values even differ per build year.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Examples:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;If you want the car to start charging at minimally 6A, the value to be sent is 6

* current_max_sum_mains

&emsp;&emsp;The Maximum allowed Mains Current summed over all phases: 10-600A
<br>&emsp;&emsp;This is used for the EU Capacity rate limiting.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Usually you should leave this setting at its default value (600A)
<br>&emsp;&emsp;since your electricity provider probably does not supports this.

* prio_strategy

&emsp;&emsp;Set the priority strategy for load sharing. Only works when PWR SHARE = Disabled or Master.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;See [Priority-Based Power Scheduling](priority-scheduling.md) for details.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;0: Modbus Address
<br>&emsp;&emsp;1: First Connected
<br>&emsp;&emsp;2: Last Connected
```
    curl -X POST 'http://ipaddress/settings?prio_strategy=1' -d ''
```

* rotation_interval

&emsp;&emsp;Set the rotation interval in minutes. Only works when PWR SHARE = Disabled or Master.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Value must be 0 (disabled) or 30-1440.
```
    curl -X POST 'http://ipaddress/settings?rotation_interval=60' -d ''
```

* idle_timeout

&emsp;&emsp;Set the idle timeout in seconds. Only works when PWR SHARE = Disabled or Master.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Value must be 30-300.
```
    curl -X POST 'http://ipaddress/settings?idle_timeout=60' -d ''
```

* cablelock

&emsp;&emsp;Enhanced cable locking option. This setting makes sure the charging cable stays locked in the charging station, even if no EV is connected anymore.

<br>&emsp;&emsp;Important:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;This feature only works if a locking device (e.g. Solenoid or Motor) is configured in the LCD menu of the EVSE.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Why is this useful?
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Semi-permanently fixed charging cable: you can attach a charging cable to the charging station, and it will stay locked.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Preventing stealing of the cable: some EV's automatically unlock the charging cable when they are finished charging, even if the EV is locked. With this setting, the cable will stay locked on the EVSE side. However, in most EV's, you can set whether the cable should remain locked in the EV itself. But some EV's don't have this option.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;
<br>&emsp;&emsp;To activate the enhanced cable lock, set the value to 1. To disable it, set it to 0.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Examples:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;If you want the enhanced cable lock activated, the string to be sent is:

```
    curl -X POST 'http://ipaddress/settings?cablelock=1 -d ''
```

# POST: /color_off

* R, G, B

&emsp;&emsp;Sets the color of the connected switch while the EVSE is in Off mode (and overrides the default setting (0, 0, 0).
<br>&emsp;&emsp;R, G and B must be send all together otherwise the data won't be registered.
```
    curl -X POST 'http://ipaddress/color_off?R=0&G=0&B=255' -d ''
```

# POST: /color_normal

* R, G, B

&emsp;&emsp;Sets the color of the connected switch while the EVSE is in Normal mode (and overrides the default green setting (0, 255, 0).
<br>&emsp;&emsp;R, G and B must be send all together otherwise the data won't be registered.
```
    curl -X POST 'http://ipaddress/color_normal?R=0&G=0&B=255' -d ''
```

# POST: /color_smart

* R, G, B

&emsp;&emsp;Sets the color of the connected switch while the EVSE is in Smart mode (and overrides the default green setting (0, 255, 0).
<br>&emsp;&emsp;R, G and B must be send all together otherwise the data won't be registered.
```
    curl -X POST 'http://ipaddress/color_smart?R=0&G=0&B=255' -d ''
```

# POST: /currents

* battery_current

&emsp;&emsp;Actual home battery current multiplied by 10
<br>&emsp;&emsp;A positive number means the home battery is charging
<br>&emsp;&emsp;A negative number means the home battery is discharging
```
curl -X POST "http://ipaddress/currents?battery_current=300" -d ''
```
...means your battery is charging at 10A per phase (3 * 10A = 30A = 300dA).

NOTE: Solar mode was removed, and it was the only mode that took the battery
current into account for current regulation. This endpoint is accepted for
backward compatibility, but the value is no longer used by any mode.

NOTE: By default the current fed here is divided by three and corrected on every phase.
If C2 is set to "Always Off", you are signalling a single phase system; in that case the correction is put fully on the L1 phase.

* L1, L2, L3

&emsp;&emsp;Note: Only works when MainsMeter == API
<br>&emsp;&emsp;L1, L2 and L3 must be send all together otherwise the data won't be registered.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Ampere must be multiplied by 10
```
    curl -X POST "http://ipaddress/currents?L1=100&L2=50&L3=30" -d ''
```
&emsp;&emsp;P.S.: If you want to send your currents through HomeAsistant, look at the scripts in the (integration)[integration] directory.

# POST: /modem

* pwm

&emsp;&emsp;The duty cycle (PWM) multiplied by 10
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Examples:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;If the desired dutycycle is 5% the value to be sent is 50
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Note: EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE ONLY FOR EXPERTS
<br>&emsp;&emsp;DO NOT USE THIS IF YOU ARE NOT AN EVSE EXPERT. DANGEROUS!


# POST: /ev_meter

&emsp;&emsp;Note: Only works when EvMeter == API
<br>&emsp;&emsp;import_active_energy, export_active_energy and import_active_power must be send all together otherwise
<br>&emsp;&emsp;the data won't be registered.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Data should be in Wh (kWh * 1000), for import_active_power data should be in w(att)

# POST: /rfid

* rfid

&emsp;&emsp;Simulate an RFID card swipe to start or stop a charging session
<br>&emsp;&emsp;The RFID parameter must be a hex string representing the card UID

<br>&emsp;&emsp;- 14 hex characters for 7 byte UIDs (newer RFID readers)
<br>&emsp;&emsp;
<br>&emsp;&emsp;The RFID will be processed using all existing checks:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;- RFID reader must be enabled in settings
<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Whitelist verification (if using local whitelist)
<br>&emsp;&emsp;- OCPP authorization (if OCPP mode is enabled)
<br>&emsp;&emsp;- RFID reader mode logic (EnableAll, EnableOne, Learn, Delete)
<br>&emsp;&emsp;
