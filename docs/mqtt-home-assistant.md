# MQTT & Home Assistant Integration

This page documents the MQTT behaviour and Home Assistant entity layout:
discovery payloads, message reduction, entity naming aligned with HA
2025.10+ conventions, and the energy zero-value guard that prevents corrupted
HA long-term statistics.

Background — community reports that motivated current behaviour:
[#320](https://github.com/dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5/issues/320) (MaxSumMains via MQTT),
[#294](https://github.com/dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5/issues/294) (per-phase kWh),
[PR #338](https://github.com/dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5/pull/338) (energy zero-guard).

## HA-compatibility behaviour

### Discovery payload fixes

| Entity | Was | Now | Impact |
|--------|-----|-----|--------|
| EV Energy Charged | `state_class: total_increasing` | `state_class: total` | Fixes corrupted HA long-term statistics (value resets per session) |
| ESP Uptime | `state_class: measurement` | `state_class: total_increasing` | Enables proper HA statistics tracking |
| Mains/EV Import/Export Energy | no `state_class` | `state_class: total_increasing` | Required for HA energy dashboard |
| Solar Stop Timer | no `state_class` | `state_class: measurement` | Enables HA graphs |

### Energy zero-value guard

Energy values (Import/Export Active Energy) are only published when > 0. Publishing
zero to a `total_increasing` sensor corrupts Home Assistant's 24h/7d/30d statistics,
showing phantom consumption. See [PR #338](https://github.com/dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5/pull/338).

### Entity naming (HA 2025.10+)

Entity IDs are now generated in `snake_case` for compatibility with HA 2025.10+
auto-generated entity names:

| Old entity ID | New entity ID |
|---------------|---------------|
| `sensor.smartevse_chargecurrent` | `sensor.smartevse_charge_current` |
| `sensor.smartevse_maxcurrent` | `sensor.smartevse_max_current` |
| `sensor.smartevse_evplugstate` | `sensor.smartevse_ev_plug_state` |

MQTT topics are unchanged — only the HA entity IDs change. Existing MQTT automations
continue to work. HA automations using entity IDs may need updating.

### New entities

| Entity | Type | Category | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| `MaxSumMains` | number | config | Maximum total mains current (settable) |
| `LoadBl` | sensor | diagnostic | Load balancing mode |
| `PairingPin` | sensor | diagnostic | Pairing PIN for device discovery |
| `FirmwareVersion` | sensor | diagnostic | Current firmware version |
| `FreeHeap` | sensor | diagnostic | ESP32 free heap memory (bytes) |
| `MQTTMsgCount` | sensor | diagnostic | Total MQTT messages published since boot |

Diagnostic entities are disabled by default in HA. Enable them in the entity
settings if you want to monitor system health.

## Change-only publishing

The biggest improvement: SmartEVSE now publishes MQTT messages **only when values
change**, instead of dumping all ~60 topics every 10 seconds.

### Impact

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Messages per minute (idle) | ~360 | ~1 |
| Messages per minute (charging) | ~360 | ~10-30 |
| Reduction | — | 70-97% |

Unchanged values are re-published at a configurable **heartbeat interval** to keep
Home Assistant long-term statistics alive.

### Settings

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `MQTTChangeOnly` | 1 (enabled) | 0-1 | Enable/disable change-only publishing |
| `MQTTHeartbeat` | 60 | 10-300 | Seconds between forced re-publish of unchanged values. 0 = never re-publish unchanged. |

### Configuration

**Via Web UI:**
Settings page → MQTT section → "Change Only" toggle and "Heartbeat" slider.

**Via MQTT:**
```bash
# Enable change-only with 120s heartbeat
mosquitto_pub -t "SmartEVSE/<serial>/Set/MQTTChangeOnly" -m 1
mosquitto_pub -t "SmartEVSE/<serial>/Set/MQTTHeartbeat" -m 120
```

**Via REST API:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://smartevse-xxxx.local/settings \
  -d "mqtt_change_only=1&mqtt_heartbeat=120"
```

### Recommendations

| Use case | MQTTChangeOnly | MQTTHeartbeat |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Standard Home Assistant | 1 (on) | 60s |
| Constrained WiFi / MQTT broker | 1 (on) | 300s |
| Critical solar automations | 1 (on) | 30s |
| Legacy setup (needs all values) | 0 (off) | — |

## SoC Injection via MQTT

SmartEVSE has a complete SoC (State of Charge) data model with `InitialSoC`,
`FullSoC`, `ComputedSoC`, `RemainingSoC`, `EnergyCapacity`, `EnergyRequest`,
and `EVCCID`. Previously, these values could only be set via `POST /ev_state`.
Now they can also be injected via MQTT `Set/` topics, enabling direct integration
with OBD-II dongles and Home Assistant automations.

### Behavior

- **Session-scoped:** All SoC values reset to -1 (cleared) when the EV disconnects.
  They do not persist across plug/unplug cycles.
- **Automatic computation:** When `InitialSoC`, `FullSoC`, and `EnergyCapacity`
  are all set (>= 0), SmartEVSE automatically calculates `ComputedSoC`,
  `RemainingSoC`, and `TimeUntilFull` based on energy charged during the session.
- **Clear with -1:** Send `-1` as the payload to clear any previously set value.

### WiCAN OBD-II Integration

A [WiCAN](https://github.com/meatpiHQ/wican-fw) OBD-II dongle reads the car's
battery SoC over CAN bus and publishes it via MQTT. Configure WiCAN to publish
directly to SmartEVSE's MQTT topic:

```
WiCAN reads SoC from car OBD-II port
  -> publishes via MQTT
  -> SmartEVSE subscribes to Set/InitialSoC

WiCAN MQTT publish topic:
  SmartEVSE/<serial>/Set/InitialSoC

WiCAN MQTT payload:
  The SoC percentage (0-100) as a plain integer string
```

Optionally also publish battery capacity:

```
SmartEVSE/<serial>/Set/EnergyCapacity
```

with the battery capacity in Wh (e.g., `64000` for a 64 kWh battery).

### Home Assistant Automation Example

Forward SoC from a car cloud integration (Hyundai, VW, Tesla, etc.) to SmartEVSE:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Forward car SoC to SmartEVSE"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.my_car_soc
    action:
      - service: mqtt.publish
        data:
          topic: "SmartEVSE/1234/Set/InitialSoC"
          payload: "{{ states('sensor.my_car_soc') | int }}"
```

Replace `sensor.my_car_soc` with your car's SoC sensor entity and `1234` with
your SmartEVSE serial number.

To also forward battery capacity and target SoC:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Forward car battery info to SmartEVSE"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.my_car_soc
    action:
      - service: mqtt.publish
        data:
          topic: "SmartEVSE/1234/Set/InitialSoC"
          payload: "{{ states('sensor.my_car_soc') | int }}"
      - service: mqtt.publish
        data:
          topic: "SmartEVSE/1234/Set/FullSoC"
          payload: "{{ states('sensor.my_car_target_soc') | int }}"
      - service: mqtt.publish
        data:
          topic: "SmartEVSE/1234/Set/EnergyCapacity"
          payload: "{{ states('sensor.my_car_battery_capacity') | int }}"
```

## Capacity tariff HA automation example

Monitor your monthly peak and get notified when it increases:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Capacity tariff peak alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.smartevse_capacity_monthly_peak
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: >
          {{ trigger.to_state.state | int > trigger.from_state.state | int }}
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "New monthly peak"
          message: >
            SmartEVSE recorded a new monthly peak of
            {{ states('sensor.smartevse_capacity_monthly_peak') }} W.
            Previous peak was {{ trigger.from_state.state }} W.
```

Track your monthly peak over time by adding the sensor to the HA Energy dashboard
or creating a statistics graph card with `sensor.smartevse_capacity_monthly_peak`.

## CircuitMeter topics

When a CircuitMeter is configured (type != 0), additional topics are published.
These follow the same change-only publishing and heartbeat behavior as other topics.

### Published state topics

| Topic | Type | Unit | state_class | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `/CircuitCurrentL1` | int | A (dA) | measurement | Circuit meter phase L1 current |
| `/CircuitCurrentL2` | int | A (dA) | measurement | Circuit meter phase L2 current |
| `/CircuitCurrentL3` | int | A (dA) | measurement | Circuit meter phase L3 current |
| `/CircuitPower` | int | W | measurement | Circuit total instantaneous power |
| `/CircuitImportEnergy` | int | Wh | total_increasing | Circuit import energy (zero-guarded) |
| `/CircuitExportEnergy` | int | Wh | total_increasing | Circuit export energy (zero-guarded) |
| `/MaxCircuitMains` | int | A | — | Max circuit current setting (number entity, always published) |

Current values use deci-Amperes (divide by 10 for Amps). The HA discovery
`value_template` handles this conversion automatically.

Energy topics are zero-guarded: they are only published when the value is > 0,
preventing phantom consumption in the HA energy dashboard (same pattern as
MainsImportActiveEnergy).

### Command topics

| Topic | Type | Range | Description |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| `/Set/MaxCircuitMains` | int | 0-600 | Set max circuit current (A). 0 = disabled. |
| `/Set/CircuitMeter` | string | `L1:L2:L3` | API mode feed — per-phase current in dA (same format as `Set/MainsMeter`). Only works when CircuitMeter type = API. |

### Home Assistant auto-discovery

When CircuitMeter is enabled, HA auto-discovery creates these entities:

| Entity | HA type | Category | Description |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `Circuit Current L1/L2/L3` | sensor | — | Per-phase circuit current (A) |
| `Circuit Power` | sensor | — | Circuit total power (W) |
| `Circuit Import Energy` | sensor | — | Circuit import energy (Wh, `total_increasing`) |
| `Circuit Export Energy` | sensor | — | Circuit export energy (Wh, `total_increasing`) |
| `Max Circuit Mains` | number | config | Settable max circuit current (A, 0-600) |

The `Max Circuit Mains` number entity is always announced regardless of whether
CircuitMeter is enabled, so you can configure the limit via HA even before setting
up the meter.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| HA energy dashboard shows wrong values | Delete the entity, restart HA, let MQTT re-discover it with corrected `state_class` |
| Entity IDs changed after update | Update automations to use new `snake_case` names |
| Too many MQTT messages | Enable `MQTTChangeOnly=1` and set `MQTTHeartbeat=120` |
| Values not updating in HA | Check `MQTTMsgCount` is incrementing; verify MQTT broker is connected |
| `FreeHeap` / `MQTTMsgCount` not showing | Enable diagnostic entities in HA entity settings (disabled by default) |
